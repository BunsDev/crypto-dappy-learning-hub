您仍在解决所有问题并与团队中的每个人会面时，天才产品经理 Peter Dappy 突然在 Slack 上向您发送信号。 
看起来他忘记了这个应用程序中的一个重要部分，您将不得不处理这件事：身份验证。

### Peter Dappy

Product Manager

*Hey! Great job with the onboarding* 👍

*We totally forgot that we need user authentication for the CryptoDappy game 🙈*

*It's needed so users can make their Dappy collections and payments in the future...*

*Can we find a blockchain solution? Thanks 🙏*

## The mission brief

This mission is all about authentication with the blockchain: Signing users in and out of their application by using a wallet. 

The starting branch for this mission is [starter](https://github.com/bebner/crypto-dappy/tree/starter)

## Flow Client Library (FCL)

Most blockchain applications consist of three parts: An application frontend, on-chain smart contracts and a wallet. In order to build CryptoDappy, you have to manage these processes in your application. This is where the Flow Client Library comes in.

## CryptoDappy authentication in one line

After we cleared all the high-level questions, it's now all about writing the actual code. This is easily done with FCL, allowing for authentication in CryptoDappy in just a few lines.
